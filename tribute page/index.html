            Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro,
            (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal), Portuguese
            football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players of his
            generation. Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment
            manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to
            Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor,
            Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s
            birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that
            necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a
            full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of
            Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as
            Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth
            teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002.

          <h3>about him</h3>

          <p>
            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing
            with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his
            first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier
            League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at
            age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the
            then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for
            Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million),
            where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del
            Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top
            goalscorer. He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and
            again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel
            Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus
            in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
            expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30
            years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and a
            Coppa Italia, before returning to United in 2021. Ronaldo made his
            international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has
            since earned over 180 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped
            player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also
            the nation's all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and
            scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international
            goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He
            assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015,
            Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the
            Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal
            to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the
            Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He
            also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in
            2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.
            One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was
            ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017
            and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time
            included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the
            world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to
            earn US$1 billion in his career.

          <p>
            At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by
            first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his
            dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for
            the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the
            first team, all within a single season. A year later, on 29
            September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against
            Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in
            their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his
            representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard
            Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsène
            Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at
            Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.
            Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire
            Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United
            3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003.
            Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to
            Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United
            players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed
            to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be "one
            of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen. A decade
            after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured
            Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.
